Gesture-Based Volume Control
This project enables gesture-based volume control using Python and computer vision technologies. It provides a touch-free way to adjust system volume by detecting hand gestures through a webcam.

Features:
Real-Time Hand Tracking: Uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to detect and track hand gestures.
Gesture-Based Control: Adjusts system volume based on the distance between specific hand landmarks.
System Integration: Automates volume control with PyAutoGUI.

Technologies Used:
Python
OpenCV
Mediapipe
PyAutoGUI

How It Works:
The webcam captures the live video feed.
Mediapipe detects hand landmarks.
Gesture inputs, like pinching, adjust the volume.
